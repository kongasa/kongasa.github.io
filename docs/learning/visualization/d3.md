Bring data to life with SVG, Canvas and HTML.

是d3的汇总项目，关键文件为根目录下的 index.js

```js
export {version} from "./dist/package.js";
export * from "d3-array";
export * from "d3-axis";
export * from "d3-brush";
export * from "d3-chord";
export * from "d3-color";
export * from "d3-contour";
export * from "d3-delaunay";
export * from "d3-dispatch";
export * from "d3-drag";
export * from "d3-dsv";
export * from "d3-ease";
export * from "d3-fetch";
export * from "d3-force";
export * from "d3-format";
export * from "d3-geo";
export * from "d3-hierarchy";
export * from "d3-interpolate";
export * from "d3-path";
export * from "d3-polygon";
export * from "d3-quadtree";
export * from "d3-random";
export * from "d3-scale";
export * from "d3-scale-chromatic";
export * from "d3-selection";
export * from "d3-shape";
export * from "d3-time";
export * from "d3-time-format";
export * from "d3-timer";
export * from "d3-transition";
export * from "d3-zoom";
```

package.json 文件定义了以上各个功能包，index.js 功能是将各个功能包合并使用 Rollup 打包。打包出来的文件可读性高，假若不怕文件过长，同组函数分散，可以直接阅读打包出来的代码。
